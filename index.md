### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorite labs as it introduced 
    a real world application of how coding can be used. In this 
    lab we were given different signs and streets and had to 
    determine if parting was available depending on the time. 
    This lab helped me gain a better understanding of Boolean 
    functions and functions in general.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was one one of my favorite labs as it introduced 
    input files. In this lab we had to store a number in an input 
    file and enter a guess which would then tell you whether it 
    matched the input number or not. This lab expanded my uses for
    coding by a lot and introduced a new function for me to explore.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was on of my favorite labs as it combined many of the
    concepts we learned throughout the semester while also touching on new topics.
    In this lab we pull from a file using a vector of vectors to find 
    densest and sparsest state populations. I enjoyed this lab because it
    had us make use of all the concepts we learned while expanding on 
    the uses of vectors.
