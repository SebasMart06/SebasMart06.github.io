# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Sebastian Martinez and 
I am a student at Cal State Fullerton(http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorite labs as it introduced 
    a real world application of how coding can be used. In this 
    lab we were given different signs and streets and had to 
    determine if parting was available depending on the time. 
    This lab helped me gain a better understanding of Boolean 
    functions and functions in general.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was one one of my favorite labs as it introduced 
    input files. In this lab we had to store a number in an input 
    file and enter a guess which would then tell you whether it 
    matched the input number or not. This lab expanded my uses for
    coding by a lot and introduced a new function for me to explore.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was on of my favorite labs as it combined many of the
    concepts we learned throughout the semester while also touching on new topics.
    In this lab we pull from a file using a vector of vectors to find 
    densest and sparsest state populations. I enjoyed this lab because it
    had us make use of all the concepts we learned while expanding on 
    the uses of vectors.

### CPSC 121

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was memorable as it introduced us to classes and their 
    functions. The user would pick a drink creating a drink object to 
    which the program manipulated the values of depending on the class
    function called. This lab showed me the value classes have and how they
    are valuable for making code more effective and efficient.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was one I remember well as it made use of maps within
    classes. The program would create bank accounts assigned a specific
    account ID capable of storing a person's name and funds as well as
    the capability to be deactivated. This lab stuck with me as it showed
    me the versatility of classes and how they can store a list of data
    capable of being accessed individually or as a group.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 was one of my favorite labs from this semester as it used
    class-oriented programming to remove and replace stored data. In this
    lab, we used a constructor to add a star object containing its name and
    measurements of it to our star class. Then the program would tell the
    user the calculated measurements of the star before it went supernova
    and was destructed from the class.
